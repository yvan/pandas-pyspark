I wanted to write a simple example for how one might go from pandas to a more distributed computing framework like pyspark, and do many of the same types of things (transforms, filterings, regex cleaning, etc). Below I'll walk you through how to do merging and conversions and do a comparison of pandas versus pyspark using the dataframes api. There's also the full notebook code here.

This example was simple but your data problems may be complex. For any of your complex data problems I'm available to hire on contract to help you build and scale whatever data decision engine you need for your business.
